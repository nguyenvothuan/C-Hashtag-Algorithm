E: set of all edges
V: set of all vertices
|X|: cardinality of X
L: the number of leaf nodes
I: the number of internal nodes
Handshaking theorem: 
        Sum of degrees of all vertices in the tree = 2|E|
        Consequence: 
        1. In a k-ary tree (nodes have 0 or k children):
            L = (k-1)*I+1
